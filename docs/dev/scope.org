* Scope
This document outlines the features PixivFE is going to implement from Pixiv.
To track the implementation of features that are **unique** to PixivFE, see the [[https://pixivfe-docs.pages.dev/dev/roadmap/][roadmap]].

A set of user & system requirements were documented in the project to form a baseline against which developers can:
- measure progress
- define what is in-scope and out-of-scope
- record decisions
- declare the intent of the project
- bring back their sanity

Acceptance criteria for each requirement is in accordance with Pixiv's features unless otherwise stated.

This document was +blatantly copied from+ inspired by [[https://github.com/labwc/labwc-scope][labwc's project scope]].

* Categorisation
Requirements are categorised as follows:

- **A**: in-scope: "must have" for minimum viable product
- **B+**: in-scope: "should/cover have" - likely to be implemented at some point
- **B**: discretionary: if devs feel like it and benefits are greater than cost (burden) of maintenance and complexity
- **C**: out-of-scope: not intended to be implemented

* Priorities

1. Stabilize current scope and fix issues and bugs. This is quite important. We do not want to spend time on an expanding scope with new features until the project is reliable at its current scope.
2. Implement Cat A requirements.
3. Implement Cat B+ requirements.
4. Review Cat B requirements and try to demote as many as possible to C

* Sections

- Requirements are organised into the sections listed below.
- The first digit in the reference number relates to the section.
