# htmx partials, a rough how-to guide

1. Update relevant HTML to pass required data via hx-headers (biggest limitation at the moment, need to figure out how to pull data from PixivFE then store it client-side)
2. Set up exported function in package core that will ingest this data, call the pixiv API, then give you the data you want
3. Set up route handler in package route, build required params, then call the exported function in core
4. Pass the fetched data to Data_{partial_name}Partial, creating a stub Jet template in this directory if needed (template.Render will search here)
5. Update package router with a REST API endpoint
6. Update HTML with htmx to hx-get the endpoint and swap it in
7. profit
